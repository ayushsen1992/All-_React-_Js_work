                       <p><strong> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen "A. P. J." Abdul Kalam</strong> (Listeni/ˈæbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/;<cite> 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015</cite>) was the
                       <sup>  11th</sup> President of India from 2002 to 2007. A career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the<mark> Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) </mark>and was intimately involved in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br>
</p>
<p>Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President,"[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours<br><br>
